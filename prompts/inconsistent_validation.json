    "Identify all critical security checks and business rules (e.g., is_frozen, utilization limits, admin-only access).",
    "Map out all distinct execution paths that can modify the same piece of state (e.g., `standard_swap` vs. `standard_swap_from`).",
    "Compare the validation logic across these parallel paths to ensure all required checks are applied consistently.",
    "Pay close attention to special-purpose functions (e.g., emergency functions, migrations) as they are common sources of missing validation.",
    "If there is a function which under certain circumstances has the same behavior than another function, it should have the same validations. Otherwise, users could circumvent the validations through it. For instance, when transfer_batch() is called with only one element, it should have the same validations than transfer()."
