    "When a value is calculated from a user-provided list of assets, verify that the code explicitly checks for and rejects duplicate assets to prevent artificial value inflation.",
    "Analyze the time between auction creation and settlement for potential race conditions where underlying asset prices or collateral values can change, leading to unfair pricing.",
    "Ensure there is a robust mechanism to clean up and finalize auctions that are completed, cancelled, or expired, preventing them from becoming permanently stuck.",
    "Verify that bids cannot be placed on an auction with invalid or outdated parameters."
