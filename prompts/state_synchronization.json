    "Verify that any in-memory caching layer is used consistently, ensuring that once data is loaded and modified, subsequent operations within the same transaction use the cached version, not the original storage version.",
    "Look for sequences where a calculation is performed, but the result is not immediately written to a shared cache or passed to the next function, leading to the result being overwritten or ignored."
