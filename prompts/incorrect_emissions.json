    "In any function where a user's stake or share balance is modified (e.g., deposit, withdraw), ensure that pending rewards are calculated and credited *before* the share balance is updated.",
    "Verify that a user's reward tracking state is updated immediately after their rewards are calculated.",
    "Audit the reward calculation formula to ensure it correctly handles users who have zero shares for a portion of the reward period, preventing them from claiming rewards they didn't earn.",
    "Confirm that the order of operations is always: 1) Calculate rewards based on old share amount, 2) Update reward index, 3) Update share amount."
